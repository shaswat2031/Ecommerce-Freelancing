Phase 1: The Core Shopping Flow (Critical)
These are essential for a user to actually buy something.

Product Details Page (PDP)
Why: When a user clicks a product on the Shop page, they need to go here.
Features: Large hero image gallery, rich description (Health Benefits, Origin/Farm info), Ingredients list, "Add to Cart" sticky button, and Related Products.
Cart / Shopping Bag
Why: To review items.
Style: Often a Side Drawer (Slide-over) is more premium than a separate page, allowing users to stay on the shop page.
Checkout
Why: To collect shipping and payment info.
Style: A clean, distraction-free stepped process (Information > Shipping > Payment).
Order Success / Thank You
Why: Confirmation styling is often overlooked but important for reassurance.
Phase 2: User Account & Engagement
Login / Register: Branded authentication pages.
User Dashboard:
Order History: Status of current orders.
Wishlist: For saved premium items (Saffron, etc.).
Addresses: Saved shipping info.
Contact / Support: A dedicated page for customer service or wholesale inquiries (since "Wholesale" is in your footer).
Phase 3: Brand Storytelling (The "Premium" Touch)
The Journal (Blog):
Why: Organic brands rely on education. Articles like "Benefits of Kashmiri Saffron" or "Farm to Table Stories" build trust and SEO.
Recipes Page: Showing how to use the products (e.g., "Saffron Milk Recipe").
Sustainability / Our Farm: A visual-heavy page showing the actual fields, farmers, and organic certification process.
